This is an example App using the Level SDK. It is not a good app, but it demonstrates how to interact with the Level SDK. The UI is not complete and using the Android Monitor to view the logs is essetential.

There are 2 screens in the app, Blink to Link, which facillitates the pairing of the device to the phone and the Dashboard. The dashboard facilitates all communication to the device. The UI is lacking when it comes to displaying the output from the device, but it is in the logs.

If you going to write your own app, the needed packages are: ble, model and receiver.

Be sure to include the BleManager service in your AndroidManifest.xml as well.
